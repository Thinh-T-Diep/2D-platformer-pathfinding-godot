Converted from C# to GDScript from [TheSolarStrings's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcezKp0rYHI)

**Note:** Some methods that return Nullable types that were used in the original tutorial in C# were converted into returning an effectively invalid result such as `Vector2i.MAX` instead of `null` 
in order to preserves the static typing of the methods and take advantage of the editor's IntelliSense. If you adopt these scripts into your game, depending on the game, this may not work as expected.
